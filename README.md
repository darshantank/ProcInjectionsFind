# ProcInjectionsFind
A ProcInjectionsFind volatility plugin runs against malware-infected memory images or memory of live VMs and examines each memory region of all running processes to conclude if it is the result of process injection. The ProcInjectionsFind volatility module is designed to automate the identification of different process injection strategies.
